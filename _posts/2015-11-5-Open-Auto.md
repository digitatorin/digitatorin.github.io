# Introduction

Initially conceived as an idea to promote the development of open-source services for co-operatives and unions, we have begun developing an app and service for auto-rickshaw drivers. The basic service should be easy enough to extend this to any kind of transport, taxi, vans etc.

# Objectives

Our core objectives:

* See if it is possible to build a sustainable open enterprise on open-source.
* Everything from the research, planning and source-code will be open. Even if we fail, hopefully something can be learned from the experiment.
* Promote a different model or type of organization
